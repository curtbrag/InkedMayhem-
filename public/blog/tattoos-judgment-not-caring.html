    <div class="blog-body">
        <p>The first tattoo I got, my mom cried. Not the dramatic movie kind — the quiet, disappointed kind that's honestly worse. She said I'd ruined my skin. That no one would take me seriously. That I'd regret it by thirty.</p>

        <p>I'm past the age she warned me about. I have more ink now than I did then. And the only thing I regret is not getting them sooner.</p>

        <p>Here's what people don't understand about tattoos: <strong>every single one is a decision to put yourself first.</strong> You're choosing to mark your body in a way that makes you happy, fully aware that some people will hate it. That's not reckless. That's radical self-trust.</p>

        <div class="blog-divider">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>The judgment comes from everywhere. Family dinners where your aunt stares at your arm like you just committed a felony. Job interviews where the interviewer's eyes drift to your wrist while they're asking about your "five-year plan." Strangers in line at the grocery store who feel entitled to ask "did that hurt?" like your body is a public exhibit.</p>

        <p>And then there's the internet, where people get bold behind a keyboard. "You'd be so pretty without all that ink." Cool, thanks, didn't ask. "You're going to look terrible when you're old." Newsflash: <strong>we're all going to look terrible when we're old.</strong> At least I'll have a cool mural to show for it.</p>

        <p>The turning point for me wasn't some big epiphany. It was smaller than that. I posted a photo showing my tattoos — all of them, no hiding, no strategic angles — and the response was split. Half the people loved it. Half had opinions. And I realized something: the people with opinions weren't going to like me either way. I could cover up, tone it down, play safe, and they'd find something else to criticize. That's what they do.</p>

        <div class="blog-divider">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>So I stopped trying to be palatable. Stopped wearing long sleeves to family events. Stopped angling my photos to hide things. <strong>Stopped apologizing for decisions I'd make again in a heartbeat.</strong></p>

        <p>The "InkedMayhem" name isn't random. It's exactly what this is — ink that causes mayhem in people's expectations. Tattoos on a girl who's also soft and funny and obsessed with her dog. A body that doesn't fit the neat little box people want to put it in.</p>

        <p>If you've got ink, or piercings, or colored hair, or anything that makes people uncomfortable — good. That discomfort is their problem, not yours. The people who matter won't ask you to shrink. They'll just pull up a chair and ask to hear the stories behind each one.</p>

        <p>And those stories? They're way more interesting than anything judgment ever produced.</p>
